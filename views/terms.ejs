Between 009 Compliance Ltd and <strong><%= formData.firm_name %></strong>

This Agreement is made between 009 Compliance Ltd and the business or individual receiving, opening, viewing, downloading, storing or otherwise interacting with any written, verbal or digital material issued by the Service Provider . This Agreement is binding automatically without signature, and acceptance occurs at the moment the Client accesses, retains or makes any use of material supplied. The only means of avoiding entry into this contract is permanent deletion of all material received and complete non-engagement with any documentation or communication issued by the Service Provider.

The Client expressly acknowledges that the Service Provider does not, and shall not be construed to, provide legal advice, regulatory consultancy, FCA advisory guidance, Consumer Duty assurance, risk assessment, outcome-based support, or any form of professional compliance advice. The Service Provider merely supplies documents, templates, examples and structural frameworks which require internal review, amendment, adaptation and correct implementation by the Client. The Client accepts that no duty of care exists, no reliance may be placed on the Service Provider, and use of material does not constitute compliance nor form the basis of any advisory relationship, contract for regulatory assurance or responsibility for outcomes. All liability for decisions, processes, submissions and operational conduct rests exclusively with the Client.

Full responsibility for compliance, Consumer Duty, affordability and suitability assessment, document editing, record keeping, processes, staff training, complaint handling, procedural oversight, FCA submissions including but not limited to CCR007 and CCR009, and any other regulatory function is borne entirely by the Client without limitation or expiration. The Service Provider bears no obligation to check, validate or verify the accuracy of any information provided by the Client. All FCA submissions originate solely from Client-supplied information, and if any data is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or results in investigation, refusal, penalty, redress or enforcement action, the responsibility remains fully and exclusively with the Client. The Service Provider shall not be liable for any regulatory consequence resulting from information provided or omitted by the Client.

Any verbal discussion, explanation or illustration provided by the Service Provider is for general understanding only and shall not be relied upon as instruction, advice or confirmation of regulatory compliance.

Where any marketing, website or promotional wording differs from this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.

Where this Agreement is presented electronically, the Client confirms and agrees that creating an account, ticking an acceptance box, submitting any information or accessing or using the Service Provider’s systems, platforms or services constitutes full and binding acceptance of this Agreement and the version of the Agreement in force at the time of acceptance.

The Client acknowledges that electronic acceptance and continued use of the Service Provider’s systems has the same legal effect as a signed written agreement and creates a legally binding contract between the Client and the Service Provider.

The Service Provider may retain electronic records of acceptance, including the date, time, user details and version of the Agreement accepted, and such records shall be conclusive evidence of acceptance for all legal and contractual purposes.

If the Client does not agree to these terms, they must not create an account, must not submit any information and must not access or use any systems, documentation or services provided by the Service Provider.

Submission of Regulatory Returns Clause

Where the Service Provider assists in preparing, completing or submitting CCR007, CCR009 or any regulatory return on behalf of the Client, such submission shall be performed strictly and exclusively on the basis of information supplied directly by the Client without assessment, verification, audit or interpretation. The Service Provider shall not check, audit, advise on, compare, analyse or determine the suitability or correctness of any figures, answers, data, policies, processes or records and shall not be required to question the Client even where information appears inconsistent, incomplete or inaccurate. The Client warrants that all information supplied is true, accurate and complete and accepts that they remain solely responsible for all compliance, regulatory outcomes, consumer duty obligations, deadlines, suitability assessments, affordability checks and consequences arising from any return. The Service Provider’s role is clerical and administrative only, consisting of transferring information into FCA systems exactly as provided.

No liability, duty of care, advisory responsibility or obligation to rectify, re-submit or defend a return exists at any time. Should the FCA, any authority, customer or third-party challenge, query, investigate or take action against the Client, all responsibility, response and outcome sit exclusively with the Client. The Client indemnifies the Service Provider against all claims, fines, penalties, disputes, losses or regulatory consequences arising from or connected to any return submitted using Client-supplied information. Delays caused by late or incomplete information shall not create any obligation for the Service Provider to meet deadlines.

This arrangement operates as a recurring monthly subscription. All payments made are non-refundable and continued provision of documents, communication and ongoing support is strictly conditional upon payments remaining up to date. If a monthly payment is missed, stopped, fails or is delayed for any reason, all engagement, support and activity by the Service Provider is immediately suspended without notice, and the Service Provider is under no obligation to submit, support or complete CCR007, CCR009 or any other compliance-related submission. The Client understands and agrees that the Service Provider is entirely absolved of responsibility for missed deadlines, regulatory penalties or consequences arising from suspension or cessation due to non-payment, and reinstatement of service shall occur only at the Service Provider’s discretion and only after all arrears are cleared in full together with any additional reconnection or catch-up fees, where applicable.

Where monthly business information is requested by the Service Provider for regulatory preparation or maintenance of documentation, prompt and accurate supply of such information by the Client is a fundamental condition of this Agreement. Failure by the Client to provide requested information, documents, figures or clarifications in a timely manner absolves the Service Provider of all obligation to complete or submit regulatory returns and removes any connection between the Service Provider and resulting regulatory outcomes. Where information is supplied late, incomplete or withheld, the Service Provider may levy additional charges for time required to reconstruct, chase or correct files. Should the Client fail to respond to three requests for information, the Agreement shall be deemed materially breached by the Client, support may cease instantly and no refund shall be due. In such circumstances, the Client accepts that the Service Provider bears no duty whatsoever to complete annual submissions, answer FCA queries or provide further assistance.

The Service Provider does not guarantee the suitability, accuracy, completeness or continued regulatory relevance of documentation. Material is supplied strictly on an “as-is” basis without warranty or representation that its use will result in FCA approval, successful Consumer Duty demonstration, complaint defence or avoidance of scrutiny. No past result or example, whether from marketing, conversation or any other client, implies that any similar result will be achieved again. The Client must ensure independent legal review of all material before implementation and accepts that ongoing monitoring of regulation is their own responsibility.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service Provider shall not, under any circumstances, be liable to the Client for direct, indirect or consequential loss, financial impact, profit reduction, reputational damage, regulatory enforcement, penalties, legal action, Consumer Duty failures, redress orders or any form of damages whatsoever whether foreseeable or claimed to arise through negligence. The maximum aggregate liability of the Service Provider to the Client is permanently fixed at £0, and the Client irrevocably waives the right to pursue compensation or legal remedy now or at any future time. The Client shall fully indemnify and hold the Service Provider harmless against all claims, actions, costs, damages, legal fees or proceedings that may arise as a result of the Client’s use, misuse, editing, implementation or distribution of supplied documents. This indemnity survives termination and continues indefinitely.

All documentation, templates and materials remain the intellectual property of the Service Provider. The Client receives only a non-transferable internal-use licence for their single business entity. Redistribution, rebranding, resale, publishing or supply to third parties is strictly prohibited. Any breach shall constitute grounds for immediate legal action and recovery of associated costs.

The Service Provider holds no obligation to provide updates, regulatory monitoring, ongoing advice or document modification following delivery unless separately contracted in writing. Informal conversation, example explanation or general discussion shall not be interpreted as ongoing support nor shall it vary the disclaimers herein.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales, and any dispute shall fall exclusively within UK courts. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force. This document supersedes all prior discussion, implication or understanding, and no statement outside its wording shall form part of the Agreement unless set out in writing and accepted mutually.

By continuing to hold, retain or use any material from the Service Provider, the Client confirms, acknowledges and agrees that they accept full responsibility for their compliance obligations, data accuracy and regulatory conduct; that they understand materials require modification and internal integration; that they waive permanently any right to reliance, duty, negligence or compensation; and that their use of material constitutes immediate acceptance of this binding Agreement, whereas non-use and complete deletion constitutes rejection. Use equals acceptance. Responsibility remains solely and permanently with the Client.

Payment, Billing and Collection of Fees

All services provided by the Service Provider operate strictly on a prepaid recurring subscription basis, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing. Fees are payable monthly in advance and must be received in cleared funds prior to any work, communication, document provision, regulatory assistance or engagement of any kind.

Payment shall be made by Direct Debit or Standing Order, at the Service Provider’s sole discretion. Where Direct Debit is used, the Client irrevocably authorises the Service Provider to collect all agreed fees from the nominated bank account in accordance with the Direct Debit mandate provided. Where payment is made by Standing Order, responsibility for ensuring that payments are set up correctly, maintained, amended and remain active rests entirely and exclusively with the Client.

All Direct Debit payments are governed by the Direct Debit Guarantee, which is provided by the Client’s bank. The Client acknowledges and accepts that where a refund is made under the Direct Debit Guarantee, whether correctly or incorrectly, the refunded amount shall immediately become a debt owed to the Service Provider and shall be payable on demand without set-off, dispute or delay. Any administrative, processing or dispute fees incurred as a result of such refund may also be recovered from the Client.

If any payment is missed, stopped, reversed, cancelled, delayed, fails due to insufficient funds or is otherwise not received in full for any reason whatsoever, all services, engagement and activity are immediately suspended without notice. The Service Provider shall have no obligation to continue work, provide documents, respond to correspondence, support FCA submissions or assist with regulatory deadlines while any amount remains outstanding. The Client accepts that suspension may result in missed regulatory deadlines, enforcement action or other consequences, and agrees that all such consequences arise solely from non-payment and remain the exclusive responsibility of the Client.

Where a Direct Debit payment fails, the Service Provider may, at its discretion, re-submit the payment. Re-submission does not constitute a waiver of rights nor create any obligation to continue services during the period of non-payment. Where a Standing Order payment is missed, the Service Provider is under no obligation to notify the Client, chase payment or provide reminders.

All fees paid are non-refundable under all circumstances, including but not limited to dissatisfaction, regulatory outcomes, FCA decisions, delays, non-use of materials, suspension of services due to non-payment, or termination of this Agreement for any reason. The Client acknowledges that fees relate to availability, access and provision of materials and support, not to outcomes or results.

The Service Provider reserves the right to amend subscription fees upon reasonable notice. Where payment is collected by Direct Debit, the amended amount shall be collected automatically following such notice. Where payment is made by Standing Order, it is the Client’s responsibility to amend the Standing Order accordingly. Failure to do so shall constitute non-payment.

Reinstatement of services following suspension for non-payment shall occur only at the Service Provider’s discretion and only once all outstanding sums are cleared in full, together with any additional charges for reinstatement, catch-up work or reconstruction of records where applicable. The Service Provider is under no obligation to prioritise or expedite reinstatement.

The Client authorises the Service Provider to use all business-level information supplied by the Client for the purposes of delivering the Services, administering subscriptions, supporting regulatory reporting and operating any commercial, introducer or funding arrangements connected to the Services.

The Client further authorises the Service Provider to disclose and share relevant business-level information with third parties including finance providers, lenders, brokers, introducers, software providers, payment processors and professional advisers where required or deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of the Service Provider for the administration of the Services, regulatory processes or the operation of subscription funding or partnership arrangements.

Such information may include, without limitation, sales volumes, finance volumes, lender usage, commission totals and other firm-level performance or transactional data.

No personal data relating to individual customers or staff shall be shared unless required by law or expressly authorised by the Client.

Where any third party contributes to, subsidises or otherwise supports the cost of the Client’s subscription or services, the Client acknowledges and agrees that disclosure of lender usage, transaction volumes and related business activity may be necessary to administer, monitor or justify such arrangements and the Client gives full and irrevocable consent to such disclosure.

The Client confirms that all business-level information supplied may be used and disclosed in accordance with this clause and waives any right to object to or restrict such use or disclosure where it falls within the scope of this Agreement.
